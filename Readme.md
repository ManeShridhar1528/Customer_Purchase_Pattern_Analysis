Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python):

Removed duplicate records

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Standardized categorical columns

Validated data types

Prepared clean dataset for SQL and Power BI analysis


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Key analysis performed

Revenue distribution across product categories

Customer segmentation by age group and gender

Subscription vs non-subscription behavior

Impact of shipping type on purchase value

Average order value analysis


SQL Analysis (Business Questions):

SQL queries were written to answer key business questions such as:

Which product categories generate the highest revenue?

Which age group contributes most to total sales?

How does subscription status affect customer spending?

Which shipping types are linked to higher average order value?

How does revenue vary by gender and category?

Advanced SQL concepts used:

GROUP BY, CASE WHEN

Aggregate functions

Business-focused filtering and ordering


Power BI Dashboard:

An interactive Power BI dashboard was built to visualize insights clearly.

Dashboard Features:

KPI cards (Customers, Revenue, Avg Purchase, Ratings)

Revenue by product category

Subscription status distribution

Revenue by age group and gender

Average order value by shipping type

Interactive slicers (Location, Gender, Size, Season)


Key Insights:

Clothing and Accessories are the highest revenue-generating categories

Footwear shows premium buying behavior

Young Adults contribute the most to total revenue

Majority of customers are not subscribed, indicating upsell potential

Customers choosing faster shipping tend to spend more


Business Recommendations:

Increase subscription adoption through targeted offers

Focus marketing on high-performing categories

Promote premium products and bundles

Encourage faster shipping options for higher order value

Use customer segmentation for personalized campaigns


Outcome:

This project successfully transforms raw customer purchase data into clear, actionable business insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
It demonstrates a complete data analytics lifecycle suitable for real-world business decision-making.
